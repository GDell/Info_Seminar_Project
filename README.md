# An Information Theoretic Analysis of the English Language Dictionary
Researcher Vincent-Lamarre and colleagues demonstrate that representing dictionaries as directed graphs reveals a latent structure in human languages, where a given word U is connected to another word V if the word U is
used in the definition of the word V.

These researchers demonstrated that by visualizing a dictionary as a
directed graph in this way, you reveal a layered structure.

## Our Goal:

For this project, we were interested in analyzing and characterizing the
defining power of the different dictionary components defined by Vincent-Lamarre
et al.

### Figure 3 - Shannon's Entropy Equation

We used Shannon's information theory and entropy equation in order to measure
the amount of information implicit in each layer in a dictionary.
